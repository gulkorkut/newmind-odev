# Sales and Customer Data Analysis Project

This repository contains the analysis and manipulation of sales and customer data. The project covers various tasks such as data cleaning, visualization, and advanced manipulations to uncover insights and trends.

---

## Objectives
1. **Data Cleaning and Manipulation**  
   - Handle missing values using statistical methods (mean/median imputation).  
   - Detect and manage outliers for columns like `price` and `spending`.  
   - Merge sales and customer datasets for a comprehensive analysis.

2. **Time Series Analysis**  
   - Analyze weekly and monthly sales trends.  
   - Identify the first and last sales days of each month.  
   - Visualize sales trends over time.

3. **Categorical and Numerical Analysis**  
   - Analyze sales based on product categories and age groups.  
   - Compare spending behaviors between genders.  

4. **Advanced Manipulations**  
   - Calculate total spending by city and rank cities accordingly.  
   - Evaluate monthly sales changes for each category.  

5. **Cohort and Pareto Analysis**  
   - Conduct cohort analysis to understand customer retention.  
   - Perform Pareto analysis to identify the top-performing products contributing to 80% of total sales.

6. **Regression Modeling**  
   - Build a regression model to predict sales using features like price and quantity.  
   - Achieve a model accuracy of **87%**, indicating high predictive performance.

## Key Findings and Visualizations

### Monthly Sales Trend  
- This visualization illustrates total sales per month. Sales tend to peak in the winter months, highlighting seasonal trends that can influence strategic planning.  

### Weekly Sales Trend  
- Weekly sales patterns exhibit sharp fluctuations. These spikes could be due to promotions, holidays, or other external factors.

### Predicted vs. Actual Sales  
- This graph compares actual sales with model-predicted sales. The high correlation demonstrates the reliability of the regression model.

## Technical Highlights
- **Libraries Used:** `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `scikit-learn`  
- **Data Cleaning:** Addressed missing and outlier values for cleaner and more accurate analysis.  
- **Time Series Insights:** Uncovered seasonal patterns and weekly fluctuations to guide decision-making.  
- **Cohort Analysis:** Studied customer purchasing behaviors and retention.  
- **Pareto Principle:** Identified top-performing products driving the majority of sales.  
- **Regression Modeling:** Achieved 87% accuracy using a linear regression model.
